	<h2 class="editable" style="text-align: center;">About us:</h2>
    <p class="editable" style="text-align: center;">We hold the faith which is common to all believers (Titus 1:4, Jude 3).We love the Lord Jesus Christ, endeavor to give Him "the first place in all things" (Col. 1:18), and have the utmost respect for His Word. We meet simply as Christians without any denominational affiliation because we treasure the testimony of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Our desire is to cooperate with Him for the accomplishment of God's eternal purpose (Eph. 3:11) by ministering the unsearchable riches of Christ (Eph. 3:18) for the building up of the Body of Christ (Eph. 4:12). We warmly receive all believers as our brothers and sisters in Christ and seek to maintain the oneness of the Spirit by keeping our focus on Christ. In addition to pursuing fellowship, we also desire to strengthen and spread the Lord's testimony on the Stanford campus. Please visit our website for more information about our club and our events.</p>
