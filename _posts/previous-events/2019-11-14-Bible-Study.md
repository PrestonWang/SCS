Yeeeep, just some crazy lovers of Jesus ðŸ™Œ. So glad to be together and to read the word of God! We covered Matthew Chapter 7 and saw how we need to be careful in our labor for the Lord. We don't want to be worker's of lawlessness mentioned in verse 23. This chaptered showed that we can do many things for the Lord, yet the Lord may not approve them because he was not the initiator of these works. May we be like the prudent man in verse 24 who hears the word of the Lord and does them.
