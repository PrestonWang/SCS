As Christians how can we overcome temptations? We saw in Matthew chapter 4 in this week's bible study that the LOrd overcame each of the Devil's temptation by the word of God. According to Ephesians chapter 6, verse 16-17, the word of God is the sword of the Spirit which we use to slay the enemy. Thus, we need to receive the word of God by means of all prayers - meaning that we pray over the word of God. Hallelujah for the word of God! At the end, we enjoyed this song: Seek ye first the kingdom of God.
