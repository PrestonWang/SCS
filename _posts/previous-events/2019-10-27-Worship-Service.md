During today's worship service, we learned that as believers, we need to flock together. The Lord considers us as His sheep and as His sheep, we need to flock together. John 10:16 says that there shall be one flock and one shepherd. An isolated sheep is easy prey to the enemy. Therefore we need to come together to encourage one another. This is our protection from the enemy. Hebrews 10:25 says: "Not abandoning our own assembling together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another; and so much the more as you see the day drawing near".
