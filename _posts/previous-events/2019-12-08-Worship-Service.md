Our last worship service before the end of the quarter! We enjoyed singing: "I will enter his gates with thanksgiving" and "Christ has come to be life". We also learned about God's economy, which is His process and arrangement to reach man, in order to fulfill His purpose. 
Aftewards, we enjoyed a potluck tomorrow. One of the families even made seafood gumbo! Delicious!
