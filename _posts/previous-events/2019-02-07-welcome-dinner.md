Kicked off the new semester with dinner and singing.&nbsp;

Here is a song we sang:

Hebrews 4:15-16 - "For we do not have a High Priest who cannot be touched with the feeling of our weaknesses, but One who has been tempted in all respects like us, yet without sin, yet without sin. Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help."
