This was our first Thursday night Bible Study of the year. This week, we started with Matthew Ch. 1. How do you know Jesus? Matthew 1 introduces us to Him in a couple of ways: first, He is a king of a long royal line. However, He is also a man—human like us! Let’s all strive to know Jesus as both man and king!
