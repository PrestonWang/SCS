We had a wonderful weekend at the intercollegiate fall retreat! We joined several other universities in the bay area for a saturday full of singing, blending, and receiving at UC Davis! We heard a fresh speaking concerning Godâ€™s heart of love for man! The Bible reveals God as reaching man and that God desires to share His life with man.
