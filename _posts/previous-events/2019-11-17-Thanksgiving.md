We had a delicious thanksgiving dinner with students and families in the Palo Alto area. We're so thankful to all the families and who helped prepared the meal for us. During the time, we also had some sharings concerning what we were thanksful for. The Lord has done so much for us this school year. Thank you Lord! 

Afterwards, we played games and had a fun evening together.
