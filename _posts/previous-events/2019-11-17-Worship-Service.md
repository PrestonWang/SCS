We really enjoyed during this worship service that we can spend time with Jesus. We sang two songs: <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/hymnstream/when-thou-wakest-in-the-morning">"When thou wakest in the morning"</a> and <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/william-jeng/take-time-to-behold-him">"Take time to behold Him"</a>. In the speaking, we learned that we can spend time with Jesus alone. It is good to take a few minutes each day to spend time with Jesus. Here are some things we can do during our time with the Lord: 
1. <b>Calling</b> – Calling on the Name of the Lord to set our mind on the spirit – 1 Cor.12:3; Rom. 8:6; 10:12-13 (1/2 Minute)
2. <b>Praying</b> – Opening our heart, softening our heart and emptying ourselves. Telling Him that we love Him – 2 Cor. 3:16; Psa. 62:8 (1 Minute)
3. <b>Pray-reading</b> – Using our exercised spirit to pray over a verse or two. Turning the verses into a personal prayer – Eph. 6:17-18; 2 Tim. 3:16 (2 1/2 Minutes)
4. <b>Confession</b> – Confessing the sins and offenses on our conscience and removing all blockages to fellowship. Asking for forgiveness and cleansing – 1 John 1:7, 9; Psa. 66:18; Isa. 59:1-2 (1 Minute)
5. <b>Consecration</b> – Presenting ourselves to the Lord afresh, giving Him the full ground in us – Rom. 12:1-2; 6:13,19; Mark 12:30 (1/2 Minute)
6. <b>Thanksgiving</b> – Giving thanks for all things; for all the persons, situations and things in your life and praising Him – Eph. 5:20; 1 Thes. 5:18 (1/2 Minute)
7. <b>Petition</b> – Asking the Lord for needs, growth and persons that need salvation – 1 Tim. 2:1: Eph. 6:18; Matt. 7:7; Psa. 143:8 (1 Minute)
