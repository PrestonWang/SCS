First worship service of the quarter on campus! 🙌 This morning, our topic was on “anxiety.” Are you anxious? Worried about your future? 1 Peter 5:7 says, “Casting all your anxiety on Him because it matters to Him concerning you.” Philippians 4:6-7 also tells us to “Let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God...will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.” Let’s practice casting our anxiety on the Lord this week, to remain in fellowship with Him, talking with Him and letting our requests be made known to God. May we keep learning to trust in the One who empowers us to do all things (Phil 4:13). Check us out next Sunday! #wehaveGodaspeace #gatheredinThyname #ihaverootsbytheriver
